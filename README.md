# EEG_forward_inverse_problem
EEG is the instant record of our brain electric activity through non-invasive conductive electrodes attached to the scalp.
EEG is the projection of activities of neural sources from the brain, recorded on the scalp.

In what way is EEG formed from neural source activities? We call it a forward problem.

How can we localize the neural source locations responsible for a specific EEG map? We call it an inverse problem. 

Why do we do the inverse problem? The main goal is to design a non-invasive and reliable source localization software for pre-surgical planning.   

In this repository, I will be sharing my findings regarding EEG forward/inverse problems from concepts to formulas.
