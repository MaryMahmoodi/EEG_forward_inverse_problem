# EEG_forward_inverse_problem
EEG is the projection of neural sources from brain,
which is the reocrd of scalp electric activities through conductive electrodes attached to scalp.
How is EEG production formulated by neural source activities? We call it forward problem.
How can we localize the probable neural source location responsible for a specific EEG map? We call it inverse problem.
