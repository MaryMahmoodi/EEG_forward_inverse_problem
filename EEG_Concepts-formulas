Dipole momentum definition at one point between two monopoles (sink and source)
𝒅= 𝐼.𝑝 . 𝒆 = 𝐼.𝑝 .𝒆
𝑃: distance between two monopoles (m) usually considered unit (1)
𝐼:current density (𝐴𝑚2 )
𝒆: vector from sink to source (two monopoles), this vector is normal to surface on
outer layer of gray matter (cerebral cortex)

dipole voltage-current equation (Poisson’s differential equation )
𝑱=𝑱𝒑+𝝈𝑬 𝑱 (𝑨𝒎𝟐 ): total current density 
𝝈: conductivity 𝑱𝒑: primary current density(in or near to cell) 
𝝈𝑬: secondary (volume) current A small volume around neuron has no net current.
𝑱=𝜵×𝑩→ 𝜵.𝑱=𝜵.𝜵×𝑩=𝟎 𝑱=𝑱𝒑+𝝈𝑬=𝑱𝒑−𝝈𝜵𝑽 𝜵.𝑱𝒑=−𝑰𝜹𝒓−𝒓𝒔𝒊𝒏𝒌+𝑰𝜹(𝒓−𝒓𝒔𝒐𝒖𝒓𝒄𝒆)
𝜵.𝝈𝜵𝑽=𝜵.𝑱𝒑:This is called the Poisson's differential equation So 𝑱𝒑, primary current density is the EEG source.
